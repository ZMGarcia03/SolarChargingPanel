# SolarChargingPanel
This Python script simulates a solar charging panel that stops charging when the assigned voltage is reached. The script provides a class SolarChargingPanel with methods to start and stop charging, and to monitor the voltage.

# To use the script:
1. Run the [script](solar_charging_panel.py) using Python.
2. Enter the assigned voltage when prompted.
3. Enter the current voltage periodically to monitor the charging process.
4. The script will display messages indicating whether charging has started or stopped based on the current voltage compared to the assigned voltage.

# Note
Adjust the assigned voltage as needed to control the charging process. Ensure that the assigned voltage is appropriate for the charging system to avoid overcharging or undercharging the battery.
